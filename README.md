# Bzl

Bzl is a CLI and UI for the [bazel] build tool that provides a premium bazel
experience to get the most out of your bazel investment.

## Getting Started

Get started with `bzl` by [downloading a release](/releases) or running an
installer:

#### Linux, Mac

```
curl -fLSs https://get.bzl.io/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

```
curl -fLSs https://get.bzl.io/install.ps1 | iex

```

## Features

- **Bazel Repository List**: visually browse bazel repositories on your
  workstation.

- **Repository Browser**: explore the target graph and bazel rules without
  having to compose or parse bazel queries manually.

- **Realtime Build Event Protocol**: build & test and observe the build event
  protocol in real time.

- **Sharable Build Results**: generate sharable links for your build & test
  invocations. Push results either to a privately-hosted `bzl` instance or to
  the cloud at <https://results.bzl.io>.

- **Dependency Tools**: automatically generate repository rules from github
  repositories.

- **Codesearch**: quickly find files within the universe of files in your build
  graph.

- **IDE Integration**: quickly jump to files and open references in your IDE.

## Pronunciation

`bzl` is pronounced like 'bezel', as in "_the bezel of a watch_". The name
invokes it's function (a wrapper around bazel).

> In the 1950s, watchmakers realized that an external bezel was the best way to
> add functions to a watch without complicating the movement, and so the
> external watch bezel was born.
